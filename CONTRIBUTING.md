# Contributing to HIRE Protocol

## RFC Process

Changes to the HIRE protocol are proposed through RFCs (Request for Comments).

### When to Write an RFC

- Adding new protocol features
- Changing existing behavior
- Deprecating functionality
- Significant clarifications

Minor typo fixes and clarifications can be submitted as regular PRs.

### RFC Lifecycle

1. **Draft** - Create a new file in rfcs/ using the template
2. **Discussion** - Open a PR, gather feedback
3. **Revision** - Update based on feedback
4. **Accepted** - Merged into main, spec updated
5. **Implemented** - Changes reflected in implementations

### RFC Template

Copy rfcs/0000-template.md and fill in:

- **Summary** - One paragraph explanation
- **Motivation** - Why is this needed?
- **Detailed Design** - Technical specification
- **Drawbacks** - Why should we not do this?
- **Alternatives** - What else was considered?
- **Unresolved Questions** - What needs more discussion?

### Naming

RFCs are numbered sequentially: 0001-feature-name.md

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Focus on technical merit. Assume good intent.
